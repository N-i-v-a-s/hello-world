This sucks

Hello world!!

My name is Nivas and I belong to species homo sapien. I learnt about some basics in coding in 'C', 'Python' and 'Windows Internals'.
I'm also a bit proficient in martial arts. And finally thanks to those geeks & nerdies for bearing my unverbally, unimpressive and boring introduction.
